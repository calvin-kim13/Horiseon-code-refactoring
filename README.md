## Refactoring Updates: HTML
The code was organized and changed into proper html semantics and made it more organized by grouping certain classes as one. Also, h4 tag was created to create a title for the benefits section in the side.

## Refactoring Updates: CSS
I made the initial css attributes more organized by grouping related attributes together and by adding comments. I also made it follow sequential order to the html code. Also, some css attributes were compressed so that it be would more efficient.
